# Agent development guide

A file to [guide coding agents](https://agents.md/).

## Requirements

- Make sure the code passes shellcheck after every change. Then format with `shfmt -l -w $script_name`
- Update this file (AGENTS.md) everytime you make a change that affects the agent. This may include adding new
  entries, sections or removing old ones.

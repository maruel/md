# md: My Development containers

Each container is locked to a repository-branch pair. No confusion. Safe parallel work.

**Safe parallel work with multiple AI coding agents.** Run Claude Code, Codex,
Amp CLI, Gemini CLI, Kilo CLI, Pi, and other tools in isolated containers
without branch conflicts, file interference, or environmental headaches.
